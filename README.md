# Experience

**Computational EM Research Assistant,** Electroscience Laboratory --
Columbus, OH\
    Aug 2023 -- Present

-   Worked under the supervision of Dr. Balasubramaniam Shanker to
    research novel methods for obtaining numerical solutions to
    Maxwell's equations

-   Created a modified Electric Field Integral Equation formulation to
    enable full-wave simulation of high-speed interconnects

-   Worked with a software development team to build and maintain finite
    element analysis (FEA) libraries\
    out of legacy Fortran code for use on high-performance clusters

-   Measured the performance and accuracy of parallelized FEA and
    Domain-Decomposition algorithms to optimize computationally
    expensive electromagnetic simulations

-   Designed a Finite-Element Boundary-Integral (FEBI) formulation that
    enforced radiation conditions through the use of Lagrange
    multipliers, allowing for the implementation of advanced integral
    equations in FEBI schemes

-   Collaborated with a geographically distributed team of researchers
    with varying scientific\
    disciplines, such as machine learning, plasma physics, and quantum
    computing

**Advanced Packaging Intern,** Advanced Micro Devices -- Remote, MI
    May 2023 -- Aug 2023

-   Worked with the signal integrity group to improve their ability to
    compute and predict electromagnetic\
    interference in PCBs

-   Collaborated with material suppliers in Japan to create anisotropic
    FR-4 models in Ansys HFSS\
    to model fiber-weave effects in PCIe buses

-   Participated in a course on the Ansys Electronics Desktop put on for
    AMD employees

**Research Assistant,** Electromagnetics Research Group -- East Lansing,
MI
    Sept 2019 -- Aug 2023

-   Developed a novel method for simulating quantum dot systems using
    harmonic balance analysis, enabling physicists to design frequency
    multipliers and mixers for quantum computers

-   Accelerated the solution of FEBI simulations using innovative
    preconditioners, Schur complement methods, and iterative solvers in
    order to bypass memory and conditioning constraints resulting from
    dense matrices

-   Worked with a geographically dispersed software development team to
    build and maintain an FEA codebase for designing RF systems in
    Python and Fortran

-   Recruited multiple undergraduate researchers by working as a
    teaching assistant for a course on electromagnetic fields and
    transmission line theory

**Research Assistant,** Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) -- East
Lansing, MI
    May 2019 -- September 2019

-   Developed a quench detection technique through simulation of surface
    current patterns in superconducting cavities illuminated at
    higher-order modes

-   Worked as part of the RF team to install and tune superconducting
    cavity resonators in FRIBs linear particle accelerator tunnel

# Education
